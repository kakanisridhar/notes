Bootstrapping


angularjs automatic bootstrapping process

0. The browser loads the HTML and parses it into a DOM
   The browser loads angular.js script


1. Angular waits for DOMContentLoaded event Angular looks for ng-app directive, which designates the application boundary

   ng-app
        html data atttribute
        e.g ng-app="optionalModuleName" 
        

2. angular loads the module named
   The Module specified in ng-app (if any) is used to configure the $injector 

3. The $injector is used to create the $compile service as well as $rootScope

4. The $compile service is used to compile the DOM and link it with $rootScope
   
   treating element where ng-app is present as root of compilation($rootScope)
   
   this will make angular restricted to particular scope
