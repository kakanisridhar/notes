Intro 

	AngularUI Router is a routing framework which allows you to organize the parts of your interface into a state machine

	UI-Router is organized around states, which may optionally have routes, as well as other behavior, attached.

	States are bound to named, nested and parallel views, allowing you to powerfully manage your application's interface.



Including in your app

		<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.1.5/angular.min.js"></script>
    		<script src="js/angular-ui-router.min.js"></script>
    	
		<script>
			var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ui.router']);
			// For Component users, it should look like this:
			// var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [require('angular-ui-router')]);
		</script>
    	
    	2.
	    	declare placeholder for your view
