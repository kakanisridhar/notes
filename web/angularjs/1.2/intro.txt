AngularJs - 		is a model view controller javascript framework

Model			Data that is shown to the user and with which the user interacts, this is just a normal javascript object

View 			What the user sees (the DOM) , composed from initial html and partial htmls loaded subsequently

Templates 		HTML with angular directives, expressions, filters

Expressions 		Access variables and functions from the scope

Directives 		Extend HTML with custom attributes and elements

Data Binding 		Two way data sync between the model and the view

			Templating system works on DOM objects not on strings. 
			The template is still written in an HTML string, but it is HTML (not HTML with template sprinkled in.) 
			The browser parses the HTML into the DOM, and the DOM becomes the input to the template engine known as the compiler. 
			The compiler looks for directives which in turn set up watches on the model. 
		        The result is a continuously updating view which does not need template model re-merging. 
		        Your model becomes the single source-of-truth for your view.


Scope 			Context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it

Controller 		Business logic which is uded for interaction between view, model and scope


Module 			Configures the Injector

Compiler 		Parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions

Dependency Injection 	Creates and wires objects / functions

Injector 		Dependency injection container


Factory			reusable business logic independent of views, TODO - learn when are different factories requied
Service			---singleton 
providers
