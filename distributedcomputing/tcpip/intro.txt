Internet Protocol (IP) - Network Layer protocol

provides a datagram service: 
every packet is handled and delivered by the network independently, like letters or parcels sent via the postal system. 
To make this work, each IP packet has to contain the address of its destination, just as every package that you mail is addressed to somebody. 
Although most delivery companies guarantee delivery of a package, IP is only a best-effort protocol: 
it attempts to deliver each packet, but it can (and occasionally does) lose, reorder, or duplicate packets in transit through the network.


TCP -  transport layer protocol

port numbers identify address of an application on specific machine

is designed to detect and recover from the losses, duplications, and other errors that may occur in the host-to-host channel provided by IP


UDP - transport layer protocol


IPv4

	IPv4 addresses are 32 bits
	IPv4 addresses are conventionally written as a group of four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 10.1.2.3); 
	this is called the dotted-quad notation. 
	The four numbers in a dotted-quad string represent the contents of the four bytes of the Internet address, thus, each is a number between 0 and 255.
	
	loopback - 127.0.0.1
		 - anything starting with 127.
	private use - 
		starts with 10 or 192.168
		startw with 172.6 or 172.31

	link-local
		starts with 69.254
	
	multicast
		224 to 239
	

IPv6	
	IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long(16 bytes).
        represented as groups of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 2000:fdb8:0000:0000:0001:00ab:853c:39al). 
        
        loopback - 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
        
        link-local
        	starts with FE8
        	
        multicast
        	starts with FF
