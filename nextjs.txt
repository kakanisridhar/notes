_app.js - entrypoint for nextjs , alternatively we can use Layout from next

userRouter  - to get access to router, router.pathname == "yourpathname"
			  router.push can force client side navigation

getStaticProps - special function to fetch static data , should return { "props": "value", "revalidate":revalidate time}


somefolder/[name].js - dynamic pages generated under "somefolder/name"

getStaticPaths - should retun an object of {paths, fallback} - where paths is like {params: {paramname: value}}
				 paramname should match the name inside []


getServerSideProps - load dynamic data on server

somename.module.css - for css module instead of global style

(site) in parentheses? 
By using parenthesis, we make the directory site "pathless", 
which means we can create new layouts, loading files, and pages in the site directory, 
without adding a new path segment to the routing.
