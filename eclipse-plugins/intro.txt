Plugins are the smallest deployable and installable software components of Eclipse.

in osgi terms bundle == plugin

Each plugin can define extension-points which define possibilities for functionality contributions ( code and non-code ) 
by other plugins. Non-code functionality contributions are for example the provision of help content.


A feature project is basically a list of plugins and other features which can be understood as a logical separate unit.

Finally, a product is a stand-alone program built with the Eclipse platform. 
A product may optionally be packaged and delivered as one or more features, 
which are simply groupings of plug-ins that are managed as a single entity by the Eclipse update mechanisms.
