1. ducktyping

def = someVar from the parent construct


2. Array notation def var1 = [
	declarations
]

iterating over an array using each and iteraion variable it 

var1.each {
	
	println "${it.attrib1} ${it.attrib2}"
}

3. implicit main method

?? all code blocks get executed as main function call???
