kubernetes - container orchestration platform - automates deployment , scaling and management of containarized applications

Admin ui + control plane

etcd - to store cluster state
controller manager - 
scheduler - 

kube proxy - networking proxy , responsible for routing and load balancing
 

Nodes:
These machines perform the requested tasks assigned by the control plane.

Pod:
A set of 1 or more containers deployed to a single node. A pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object.


deployment:


replica set:
A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.


HorizontalPodAutoscaler:



Service:
A way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service. This decouples work definitions from the pods.


persistent volume - file system mounted to cluster


pod - a unit of replication

deployment - abstraction used for deploying pods




deploying
----------------------

persistent volume claim

config map



networking
-----------------------

pods are ephemeral , as pods come and go we need a service to access the pod

cluster ip - Default type of service , port and targetport , replicas , selectors play the role of connecting service to pods


NodePort - when you want to directly expose a node port to external world , not secure as clients can talk to node

Headeless service  - when you want to directly communicate with pod

load balancer -
