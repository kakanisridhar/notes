always seperate infrastructure from Problem Domain



Bean Layers

    Controllers (for MVC, System Domain)
    Services (Problem Domain)
    Repository (System Domain)

Other Bean Categories

    Data Transfer Objects (Problem Domain)
    System Functions (System Domain)



Spring annotations can be very useful for services, useful annotations are @Service and @Transactional. 
To abstract away the infrastructure from the business services, create a project specific meta annotation.
