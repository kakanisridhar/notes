Architecture


Gossip - peer to peer communication protocol
	
	 list of nodes(seed nodes) have to be configured in a cluster based on geographical distribution of network
	 inorder to prevent partitions in network

Partitioner - distribute data across nodes in cluster

Replica placement strategy - store copies of data for fault tolerance

Snitch - responsible for knowing the location of nodes within your network topology and distributing replicas 
         by grouping machines into data centers and racks


Cassandra node acts as front
