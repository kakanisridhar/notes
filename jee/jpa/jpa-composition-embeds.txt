Embedding Objects

  
  These are value types which have no identity of there own.
  
  Though they are developed as seperate classes for oops purpose they end up in the same table of an entity class.
    
 
 @Embeddable - 
	Specifies a class whose instances are stored as an intrinsic part of an owning entity and share the identity of the entity. 
	Each of the persistent properties or fields of the embedded object is mapped to the database table for the entity. 
	
 @Embedded
        Specifies a persistent field or property of an entity whose value is an instance of an embeddable class. 
        
        
 
@Embeddable objects can contain relations to other entities as similar to their parent entities
