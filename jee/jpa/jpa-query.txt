ResultSet Mapping


in case of normal queries it should be BAU


if result sets are to be mapped to types use 

"SELECT NEW <<full class name>>( e.name, e.department.name)" +
                       "FROM Project p JOIN p.employees e " +
                       "WHERE p.name = ?1 "  +
                       "ORDER BY e.name" 



supports query hints for paging, batch sizes


best place to define hints is using mapping file
