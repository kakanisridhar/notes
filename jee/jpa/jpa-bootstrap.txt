1. Managing Entities


 Persistence unit - template for configuring EntityManagerFactory
 
 EntityManagerFactory - The configuration for an entity manager is templated from the EntityManagerFactory that created it, but it is defined separately as a persistence unit.
 
 One to one correspondence between Persistence unit <-->  EntityManagerFactory
 
 

 EntityManager - I - manages entities
 
 
 Persistence context - 
 
 When an entity manager obtains a reference to an entity, either by having it explicitly passed in as an argument to a method call or because it was read from the database, 
 that object is said to be managed by the entity manager. The set of managed entity instances within an entity manager at any given time is called its persistence context. 
 Only one Java instance with the same persistent identity may exist in a persistence context at any time.

 Many entity managers can point to the same persistence context. 
 
 Programs work with entity managers. Persistence Context is for transaction purpose. **http://tomee.apache.org/jpa-concepts.html - actually Persistence Context is an L1 cache


 lifecycle of persistence context is bound to the transaction Object Ref Equality is only guaranteed in the case of same EM-Transaction combination
 
 
 EntityManager  - is not thread safe and should not be used from multiple threads so better way is to use EJB/singletons to hold reference to  EntityManager
