simple tag handlers - tag handlers implementing javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.SimpleTag  - jsp 2.0
classic tag handlers - tag handlers implementing Tag, IterationTag, or BodyTag

SimpleTagSupport - basic implementation of SimpleTag

lifecycle

	The JSP container creates an instance of a simple tag handler by calling its no-argument constructor.
	Therefore, a simple tag handler must have a no-argument constructor.

	The JSP container calls the setJspContext method, passing a JspContext object: The most important method of JspContext is getOut, which returns a JspWriter for sending response to the client. 
	The signature of the setJspContext method is as follows. public void setJspContext(JspContext jspContext)
	In most cases, you will need to assign the passed in JspContext to a class variable for later use.
	

	If the custom tag representing the tag handler is nested within another tag, the JSP container calls the setParent method.
	This method has the following signature: public void setParent(JspTag parent)
	

	The JSP container calls the setter for each attribute defined for this tag.

	If a body exists, the JSP container calls the setJspBody method of the SimpleTag interface, passing the body as a JspFragment.
	The JSP container will not call this method if the tag does not have a body.

	The JSP container calls the doTag method. All variables are synchronized when the doTag method returns.
